"""
Rollback builder.

Purpose
If verification fails, we need a safe path back to the prior state.
This module builds a rollback ChangePlan using a pre change snapshot.

Snapshot format
pre_snapshot is a dict:
  device name -> dict of model path -> value

We only rollback the paths that were modified by the original plan.
This keeps rollback minimal and reduces blast radius.
